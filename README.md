# FBIZ LWC Salesforce Case Study 1

The business has asked to have an option to minimize the left hand menu options into a collapsed menu list with just an icon.  At certain parts of the business process the menu will need to show the full menu (as the LWC currently looks today), but at other times in the process they need additional screen real-estate space and would like to minimize the menu options to a single icon.  Your job is to figure out how to best meet the business's requirements.

##Step 1
1) After reviewing the code, document what you plan to do.
2) How much time do you estimate this taking you?
3) Identify existing code ineficiencies, and how you plan to simplify the code.  

##Step 2
1) Pull the code into a scratch/dev org and make the changes.
2) Send a screenshot of full menu, and the collapsed menu to the hiring manager.
